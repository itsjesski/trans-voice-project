# Trans Voice Project

This project is built to try to help transgender people find their voice. One of the best forms of feedback during voice training is simply sharing samples with others. This app will allow users to upload voice clips for anonymous feedback from other users. In doing so, it is our hope that everyone might find a voice that makes them happy.

## How to use

## Configuration

### Step 1. Get the connection string of your MongoDB server

In the case of MongoDB Atlas, it should be a string like this:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@my-project-abc123.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

For more details, follow this [MongoDB Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/drivers/) on how to connect to MongoDB.

### Step 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `MONGODB_URI` should be the MongoDB connection string you got from step 1.

### Step 3. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
